      "body": "Have you ever wondered about one magic activity that could reduce the brain fog that comes with age, prevent depression, stress, lowers blood pressure and lowers the odds of having heart problems, or simply makes you feel and look beautiful? Well there is definitely one such activity that covers it all: Exercise. \n\n Exercise is the physical activity that  is planned, structured and repetitive intended to improve or maintain physical health. Generally in exercise you work up to sweat, with increased breathing rate and heart rate.\n\nWHO recommends adults aged 18-64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week. CDC and NHS recommends the same amount of exercise for people 65 and above if they are generally fit and have no limiting health conditions. In case if we are restrained by our health, we can at least try to be as physically active as our abilities or the health conditions allow.\n\nModerate intensity Exercise includes brisk walking, dancing, riding a bike, hiking. While hiking uphill, energetic dancing, jogging or running, swimming fast will race up our heart rate and will be termed vigorous intensity Exercise. Muscle strengthening is an important aspect in maintaining a healthy body and should not be ignored. CDC states that stronger muscles help reduce the risk of falling and improve the abilities to perform the daily tasks of life. Carrying heavy shopping bags, yoga, doing Exercises that use our own body weight like squats, and push-ups can help make our muscles strong.\n\nSo, what really happens to our body when we Exercise?\n\nRecent research has suggested that the Exercise we do to improve our body also helps our brain.When we do high intensity Exercise our heart rate increases, supplying more blood flow to the brain. The increased heart rate also increases our breathing, making us breathe harder and faster. As a result more oxygen is supplied in our blood stream, more oxygen reaches our brain. This leads to neurogenesis, which is the production of neurons. Research has indicated that physical Exercise increases neurogenesis in the hippocampus, brain area important for learning and memory. Additionally, Exercise also influences the neurotrophins, it’s the family of protein that aids in neuron survival, development and function. This leads to greater brain plasticity and as a result better memory and learning. Regular physical activity lowers the risk of developing cognitive impairment, such as dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. This improvement from the exercise is for people with normal and also impaired cognitive health, including people with ADHD, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. \n\nAdditionally, exercise also modulates the secretion of major neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin which are linked with treating depression. Indirectly, Exercise improves mood and sleep, and reduces stress and anxiety. Trouble in these aspects of our life frequently causes or contributes to cognitive impairment.\n\nDespite all this knowledge we often find ourselves not doing the required amount of Exercise. I am sharing the following tips that may help to make Exercise a habit:",

      "body": "Cognitive function decline is a common concern for many seniors—and as the population of older adults continues to grow, experts suspect that it may grow into a broader public health issue. Symptoms of cognitive decline include confusion, slower thinking, difficulty concentrating, and memory loss. Some older individuals experience only mild cognitive impairment; however, for others, these symptoms can be an early harbinger of progressive diseases like Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia.\n\nThe Prevalence and Impact of Cognitive Decline\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), around 1 out of every 9 adults in the US (or 11%) reported symptoms of cognitive decline. In 2020, it was estimated that 5.8 million Americans had Alzheimer’s—a number that is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades.\n\nCognitive decline and dementia can have a significant negative impact on seniors’ well-being and quality of life. Often, individuals experiencing cognitive impairment are less likely to be able to perform activities of daily living and self care, which in turn may make it difficult or impossible to continue living independently. In some cases, cognitive decline has also been linked to poorer health outcomes, particularly among individuals who are already dealing with chronic health problems.\n\nThe Mental Benefits of Exercise\nAs of yet, there’s no cure available for age-related cognitive decline or dementia, although there are treatments that can help manage or slow the progression of Alzheimer’s. However, research suggests that lifestyle factors such as exercise can play a big role in helping individuals preserve or restore cognitive function as they age. Here’s a brief summary of how physical activity can help keep you sharp in your golden years:",

      "body": "For many people, exercise takes on the quality of an unpleasant obligation. We know we should do it, but it can be hard to find the motivation to actually get up and do it sometimes. For starters, the psychological influence of referring to it as “working” out, rather than exercising, automatically creates a connection in our brains that this is “work”. \n\nTo address the disconnect, it can be helpful to think about any fitness activity as exercise, rather than “working” out to start to reframe the role that exercise plays in our life. Rather than thinking of exercise as an inconvenient obligation, what if we switched to thinking about exercise as a powerful tool for leading a healthier happier life? Or as a means of preventing and even treating diseases both physical and mental? What if we thought of exercise as medicine?\n\nOur mentality drives our relationship with exercise. Our brains are powerful tools that can make us love or hate something. Let us share all the reasons to start reframing how we think about exercise in 2023.",
